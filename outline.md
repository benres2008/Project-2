Title: 

Exotic Market Menu

Description:

Our app will ask the user a series of questions to determine what exotic foods they are interested in ordering. After answering all the questions, they will be left with a recommendation (ex: shark fin's soup, rhino, etc.). Our options for the food will be stored in our database in mysql, and each questions they answer will narrow down their options until they are left with a single recommendation. 

Requirements:
